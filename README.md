# Real-time Monitoring and Security Architecture for IoT Infrastructures Using Neural Networks


Title:
Real-time Monitoring and Security Architecture for IoT Infrastructures Using Neural Networks

Introduction:
In the burgeoning landscape of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, ensuring the security and integrity of IoT infrastructures has become paramount. This project endeavors to address this pressing need by proposing an innovative architecture designed to monitor and safeguard the security of IoT installations in real-time. Leveraging the power of neural networks, the proposed architecture aims to analyze network traffic generated by IoT devices, detect anomalous patterns indicative of potential security threats, and promptly issue alerts to mitigate risks.

Description:
The proposed architecture consists of several interconnected components, each playing a crucial role in the overarching objective of IoT security. At its core lies a neural network-based monitoring system capable of processing and analyzing vast volumes of network traffic data in real-time. This monitoring system is trained on labeled datasets, such as the IoT-23 dataset, to recognize both benign and malicious traffic patterns. By continuously monitoring incoming network traffic, the neural network can identify deviations from normal behavior and trigger alerts when suspicious activities are detected.
