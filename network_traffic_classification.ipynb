        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "In this notebook, we will explore the process of classifying Internet of Things (IoT) network traffic using neural networks. IoT devices are becoming increasingly prevalent in various domains, ranging from smart homes to industrial automation. However, the proliferation of these devices also raises concerns about security, as they can be vulnerable to cyber attacks.\n",
        "\n",
        "One approach to enhance IoT security is by analyzing network traffic to detect and classify malicious behavior. In this project, we will develop a neural network model that can classify IoT network traffic into different categories, such as benign and malicious.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Dataset\n",
        "We will use the IoT-23 dataset, which contains labeled network traffic captures from both benign and malicious IoT devices. This dataset was created as part of the Avast AIC laboratory with the funding of Avast Software. It includes various features extracted from network traffic, such as source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, network protocols, and more."
